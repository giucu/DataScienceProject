## Diagnosis Types:
#### Consists of 6 distinct diagnosis, 3 skin diseases and 3 skin cancers.

* Skin diseases:
    * Actinic Keratosis (ACK) 
        * A dry, rough, and sandpaper-like patch of skin.
        * Typically small in size and not far off from the original colour of skin.
        * Usually a precursor to more serious disease like skin cancer, caused by prolonged sun exposure.
        * Despite the low risk, up to 10% ACK can develop into SCC within 2 years if the patches remain for long times
        * [Source](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/actinic-keratoses/)
        * Short-wavelength UVB damage to DNA causes aberrant skin cell growth, which leads to actinic keratoses. Poor immune function brought on by aging, recent sun exposure, underlying diseases, or certain medications increases the likelihood that they may manifest.  Actinic keratosis frequently occurs in numerous keratoses, though it can occur alone. The way they appear differs: a flat or thickened papule, or plaque, white or yellow; scaly, warty, or horny surface , skin coloured, red, or pigmented, tender or asymptomatic.

    * Nevus (NEV)
        * Very common skin disease in the form of a brown colored collection of cells, otherwise resembling moles.
        * We observe many melanocityc naevi ( in simpler terms moles. They are a common benign skin lesion due to a local proliferation of pigment cells. There are many reasons as to why one may posses such lesions - family history, somatic mutations, etc. They can be flat or stick out, and come in various colors from pinkish to dark brown or black. Light-skinned people usually have lighter-colored moles, while dark-skinned people tend to have darker ones. Moles can be round or oval, but sometimes they're odd shapes. They can be as small as a few millimeters or as big as several centimeters across. They can arise on different parts of the body.

    * Seborrheic Keratosis (SEK)
        * A seborrheic keratosis is a type of skin growth. A knobby overgrowth of keratinocytes is referred to as keratosis. In the epidermis, or outer layer of the skin, keratinocytes are the most prevalent type of skin cell. The growths don't pose a threat. But occasionally, it might be challenging to differentiate a seborrheic keratosis from melanoma, a particularly dangerous kind of skin cancer.
Typically, a seborrheic keratosis has no symptoms. But for certain individuals, it might: be uncomfortable and unpleasant, but depending on where it is, it usually doesn't hurt to catch on clothes. Rarely, a person may have an abrupt increase in the amount of seborrheic keratosis growths. This could be the extremely unusual "Leser-Trélat sign," which suggests that a person may have leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer, or gastrointestinal cancer.Causes of seborrheic keratosis include: A family history of seborrheic keratosis, Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genetic mutation, PIK3CA genetic mutation, Pregnancy, Hormone therapy. People are more likely to develop seborrheic keratosis if they: Are age 50 or older, Have spent a significant amount of time sunbathing or with the skin exposed to the sun, Are pregnant, etc

* Skin cancers:
    * Basal Cell Carcinoma(BCC)
    * Squamous Cell Carcinoma / Bowen's disease (SCC)
         * Bowen disease presents as a localized area of abnormal skin, often appearing as a well-defined, red, scaly patch or plaque.
         * Bowen disease is considered a precursor to invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
         * asymptomatic skin disorder, meaning lesions usually not causing any pain to the individuals
         * affects the outermost layer of the skin
         * it's considered a pre-cancerous condition, but the risk of cancer developement is less than 10%.
         * quite an aggressive cancer if left untreated
         * Treatment for Bowen disease is usually highly successful, with various options available including topical medications, cryotherapy, and surgical removal.

    * Melanoma (MEL)
       * Melanoma, a type of skin cancer originating in melanocytes, cells responsible for producing melanin. While the exact cause of melanoma remains unclear, most cases            are linked to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from sunlight or artificial sources. The incidence of melanoma is rising, particularly among individuals under 40,           notably women.

 ## Summary:
 * Certain moles like dyplastic nevus might appear in different colors and assymetric shape that resemble melanoma but are still benign. Similarly, a spitz nevus also has a different color and dome shape while bleeding and other liquids can made it difficult to distinguish from melanoma [Source](https://www.healthline.com/health/nevus#types)
 * Another difficulty in distinguishing diagnosis is between ACK and SCC. While ACK will typically resolve itself, the similar crusty and bumpy appearance of SCC will require some creams, cryotherapy or other forms of intervention to be treated depending on how widespread it has developed to avoid fatalities.

 * Unlike ACT, SEK is lower risk but can have a similar appearance. However, it can be distinguished sometimes by its more wart-like appearance, with a more scale-like texture and show up less frequently on face, chest, back, stomack or shoulders, and never on hands or feet soles.

 * The skin deseases have a few key elements in common such as:
1. Skin origin, as all of them represent abnormalities on the skin.

2. Benign Nature: In most of the cases, apart from the Actinic Keratosis, which may progress to skin cancer if left untreated, the rest of the skin deseases have a benign nature, which means that the treatment for them is not mandatory, as long as they do not progress into something more dangerous and are evaluated by a healthcare professional.

3. Sun Exposure: In this case, while Nevus is not necessarily produced by the sun, it can influence it. However, Actinic Keratosis and Seborrheic Keratosis happen due to long sun exposure.

4. Need for Evaluation: The one aspect any of these skin deseases have in common is that all of them require medical evaluation. Actinic keratosis, being precancerous, requires prompt attention and often treatment to prevent progression to skin cancer.

 * Skin cancers also share a few common aspects like:
1. Origin: All of the skin cancers arise from different types of skin cells such as basal cells (BCC), squamous cells (SCC) and melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells of the skin (Melanoma).

2.Sun Exposure: Both the skin deseases and skin cancers are associated with sun exposure. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds is a significant risk factor for all three types of skin cancer. UV exposure damages the DNA in skin cells, leading to mutations that can result in cancerous growths.

3. Location of the Body: Apart from Melanomas, which can develop anywhere on the body, Basal Cell Carcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma usually occur on sun-exposed areas such as the face, ears, neck, arms or scalp.

4. Treatment: The treatment is mandatory and it may include surgical removal, chemitherapy and targeted therapy, depending on the type and stage of cancer.

5. Prevention: Strategies to prevent all three types of skin cancer include limiting sun exposure, wearing protective clothing and sunscreen, avoiding tanning beds, and performing regular skin self-examinations to detect any changes or suspicious growths early.


 * Overall, while skin cancers and skin diseases may have distinct characteristics and treatment approaches, their relationship underscores the importance of comprehensive skin care and vigilant monitoring to promote early detection and optimal management of both conditions. Regular skin examinations and consultations with healthcare professionals are essential for individuals at risk or those with preexisting skin conditions.

#### Is there some missing data? Are there images of low quality? Etc.

All of the images in the dataset were captured on smartphones by the patients themselves. From extensive viewing of the dataset, the following trends in image quality have been observed:

1. Image resolution variation:
	As a result of being captured on different devices, the images have different resolutions. Although all of the images are cropped and resized to 750x750, the original resolution still has an effect on the quality of the image. Devices with better capture systems will yield higher quality images with more pixel information, even after being cropped and resized. It is difficult to predict exactly how this will impact the algorithm, it may be an impairment or it may prove beneficial because it will be able to classify a wider range of images.

2. Lighting conditions:
	The images span a wide variety of lighting conditions. Some images were taken with a flash, some taken in dark lighting, some have high contrast and visible shadows, some were taken under natural lighting and some under artificial lighting. Again, this may be be either beneficial or problematic for the algorithm. 

3. Color reproduction
	Because the images are captured with a wide assortment of devices by amateur photographers, there's no guarantee on color reproduction. White balancing is a task often left to the device to handle on its own but it can sometimes give incorrect results. Some of the images may be too warm or too cold depending on the ground truth. In their paper "The impact of patient clinical information on automated skin cancer detection", Andre G.C. Pacheco, Renato A. Krohling use this data set to train a skin cancer detection algorithm, and acknowledge the issue of color reproduction. They attempted to remedy it by color shifting the images as part of the pre-processing stage.

4. Focus
	Unfortunately, not all skin lesions are captured in focus of the camera, leading to a blurrier image that is more difficult to read. It goes without saying that blurry images are not ideal for training. Luckily only a small subset of images are impacted this way.

5. Biopsy-proven images
	As acknowledged by the dataset authors, not all skin lesions included are biopsy-proven. The absence of histopathological confirmation for all lesions introduces a degree of uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the disease labels assigned to these images. This lack of verification can hinder the training of reliable and precise diagnostic models.

6. Skin tone diversity
	The dataset exhibits a lack in representing darker skin tones. This limitation is a significant drawback, as the effectiveness and reliability of dermatological diagnostic tools depend on their performance across a diverse range of skin types. The underrepresentation of darker skin tones in the dataset can lead to biased algorithms that are less accurate for individuals with darker skin, a critical issue in ensuring equitable healthcare outcomes.
