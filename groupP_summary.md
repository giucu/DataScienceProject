## Diagnosis Types:
#### Consists of 6 distinct diagnosis, 3 skin diseases and 3 skin cancers.

* Skin diseases:
    * Actinic Keratosis (ACK) 
        * A dry, rough, and sandpaper-like patch of skin.
        * Typically small in size and not far off from the original colour of skin.
        * Usually a precursor to more serious disease like skin cancer, caused by prolonged sun exposure.
        * Despite the low risk, up to 10% ACK can develop into SCC within 2 years if the patches remain for long times
        * [Source](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/actinic-keratoses/)
        * Short-wavelength UVB damage to DNA causes aberrant skin cell growth, which leads to actinic keratoses. Poor immune function brought on by aging, recent sun exposure, underlying diseases, or certain medications increases the likelihood that they may manifest.  Actinic keratosis frequently occurs in numerous keratoses, though it can occur alone. The way they appear differs: a flat or thickened papule, or plaque, white or yellow; scaly, warty, or horny surface , skin coloured, red, or pigmented, tender or asymptomatic.

    * Nevus (NEV)
        * Very common skin disease in the form of a brown colored collection of cells, otherwise resembling moles.
        * We observe many melanocityc naevi ( in simpler terms moles. They are a common benign skin lesion due to a local proliferation of pigment cells. There are many reasons as to why one may posses such lesions - family history, somatic mutations, etc. They can be flat or stick out, and come in various colors from pinkish to dark brown or black. Light-skinned people usually have lighter-colored moles, while dark-skinned people tend to have darker ones. Moles can be round or oval, but sometimes they're odd shapes. They can be as small as a few millimeters or as big as several centimeters across. They can arise on different parts of the body.

    * Seborrheic Keratosis (SEK)
        * A seborrheic keratosis is a type of skin growth. A knobby overgrowth of keratinocytes is referred to as keratosis. In the epidermis, or outer layer of the skin, keratinocytes are the most prevalent type of skin cell. The growths don't pose a threat. But occasionally, it might be challenging to differentiate a seborrheic keratosis from melanoma, a particularly dangerous kind of skin cancer.
Typically, a seborrheic keratosis has no symptoms. But for certain individuals, it might: be uncomfortable and unpleasant, but depending on where it is, it usually doesn't hurt to catch on clothes.

* Skin cancers:
    * Basal Cell Carcinoma(BCC)
    * Squamous Cell Carcinoma / Bowen's disease (SCC)
    *    - Bowen disease presents as a localized area of abnormal skin, often appearing as a well-defined, red, scaly patch or plaque.
         - Bowen disease is considered a precursor to invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
         - asymptomatic skin disorder, meaning lesions usually not causing any pain to the individuals
         - affects the outermost layer of the skin
         - it's considered a pre-cancerous condition, but the risk of cancer developement is less than 10%.
         - quite an aggressive cancer if left untreated
         - Treatment for Bowen disease is usually highly successful, with various options available including topical medications, cryotherapy, and surgical removal.

    * Melanoma (MEL)
      Melanoma, a type of skin cancer originating in melanocytes, cells responsible for producing melanin. While the exact cause of melanoma remains unclear, most cases are        linked to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from sunlight or artificial sources. The incidence of melanoma is rising, particularly among individuals under 40,               notably women.

 ## Summary:
 * Certain moles like dyplastic nevus might appear in different colors and assymetric shape that resemble melanoma but are still benign. Similarly, a spitz nevus also has a different color and dome shape while bleeding and other liquids can made it difficult to distinguish from melanoma [Source](https://www.healthline.com/health/nevus#types)
 * Another difficulty in distinguishing diagnosis is between ACK and SCC. While ACK will typically resolve itself, the similar crusty and bumpy appearance of SCC will require some creams, cryotherapy or other forms of intervention to be treated depending on how widespread it has developed to avoid fatalities.

 * Unlike ACT, SEK is lower risk but can have a similar appearance. However, it can be distinguished sometimes by its more wart-like appearance, with a more scale-like texture and show up less frequently on face, chest, back, stomack or shoulders, and never on hands or feet soles.
