Go through the data (images and meta-data) that you have available to understand what's available to you. For example:

    What types of diagnoses are there, and how do they relate to each other? You can use Google Scholar or other sources, to learn more background about these diagnoses.
    Is there some missing data? Are there images of low quality? Etc.

Write a summary about your findings in a single groupXX_summary.md file:

    This can just be plain text document of 1-2 pages with text and some headings. Do not forget to add your sources/references.
    Do not worry about the format too much, since later in the report course we will use LaTeX
    It is a requirement that each group member makes non-trivial updates to this file
