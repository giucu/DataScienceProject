Go through the data (images and meta-data) that you have available to understand what's available to you. For example:

    What types of diagnoses are there, and how do they relate to each other? You can use Google Scholar or other sources, to learn more background about these diagnoses.

Diagnosis Types:
Consists of 6 distinct diagnosis, 3 skin diseases and 3 skin cancers.

* Skin diseases:
    * Actinic Keratosis (ACK) 
        * A dry, rough, and sandpaper-like patch of skin.
        * Typically small in size and not far off from the original colour of skin.
        * Usually a precursor to more serious disease like skin cancer, caused by prolonged sun exposure.
        * [Source](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/actinic-keratoses/)
    * Nevus (NEV)
        * Very common skin disease in the form of a brown colored collection of cells, otherwise resembling moles.
        * We observe many melanocityc naevi ( in simpler terms moles. They are a common benign skin lesion due to a local proliferation of pigment cells. There are many reasons as to why one may posses such lesions - family history, somatic mutations, etc. They can be flat or stick out, and come in various colors from pinkish to dark brown or black. Light-skinned people usually have lighter-colored moles, while dark-skinned people tend to have darker ones. Moles can be round or oval, but sometimes they're odd shapes. They can be as small as a few millimeters or as big as several centimeters across. They can arise on different part of the body.

* Skin cancers:
    * Basal Cell Carcinoma(BCC)

 Summary: #(and how do they relate to each other?)
 

    Is there some missing data? Are there images of low quality? Etc.
