* Some of the images were hard to discern. For example, PAT_1547_1876_839 doesn't seem to show any clearly defined lesion, but rather a broader area of skin irritation. PAT_1051_220_356 was also hard to annotate for the same reason, hard to see where the lesion begins and ends.
* How closely should the mask fit the lesion? How much "padding" is ideal?
